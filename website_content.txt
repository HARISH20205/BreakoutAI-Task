INTRODUCTION:
This eCommerce case study delves into eBramha’s successful B2B partnership with a Fan manufacturing OEM, featuring nearly 100 products and 17 models.
Explore how our customized eCommerce solutions addressed their specific B2B challenges, leading to a complete digital transformation of their website.
CLIENT CHALLENGE:
The client, a Fan manufacturing OEM, encountered significant challenges, including security issues, limited supply chain visibility, insufficient stock information, communication gaps, and low website traffic.
Additional challenges included:
• Implementing a minimum order value system for each dealer based on product selection.• Categorizing dealers into different tiers.• Real-time inventory checks and sales data updates for dealers.• Ensuring seamless communication between the client’s departments, distributors, and dealers.• Monitoring dead stock and outstanding payments across distributors and dealers.• Ongoing maintenance and updates of the eCommerce site.• Developing a unified B2B-B2C eCommerce website.
SOLUTION AND APPROACH:
eBramha designed a comprehensive B2B eCommerce portal to meet these needs, including the development of a new website to expand market reach. Built on Magento, the site offers high security and scalability.
We developed a custom module for setting minimum order values for each dealer, tailored to the client’s requirements.
Integration with the client’s inventory management and financial systems enables real-time updates on inventory, payments, and shipping, improving the overall process flow.
Dealer categorization, as requested by the client, is reflected based on login credentials. Pricing and discounts vary depending on the type of login (dealer, employee, or user).
Our eCommerce portal provides complete visibility into dead and stagnant stocks across India, allowing the client to manage and redistribute these stocks efficiently.
The B2B portal streamlines communication across departments by notifying all relevant teams of orders and enabling real-time tracking.
Order tracking is integrated with WhatsApp for convenience.
A separate module for warranty registration was developed, allowing dealers to register warranties on behalf of their customers.
Dealers manage their inventory, with data constantly updated to a master database in real-time for the client’s overview.
A credit card payment gateway was added to the portal, supporting both traditional (cash, DD, or cheque) and online (credit card, debit card, net banking, and UPI) payment methods.
We extended the B2B module to B2C, allowing customers to purchase directly from the website, with fulfillment handled by the distributor in their zone. No minimum order value is required for customers on the B2C portal.
Our B2C portal ensures product authenticity, trust, and confidence, addressing potential concerns with third-party marketplaces.
The drop-ship program on the B2C platform helps maintain a centralized inventory, with eCommerce fulfillment managed by the zonal distributor for any order placed through any dealer.
RESULTS AND IMPACT:
The results have been outstanding. Our tailored eCommerce solutions have created a highly secure and user-friendly interface that meets the client’s unique needs. Features like minimum order values, dealer categorization, dynamic pricing, unique order tracking, a drop-ship program,centralized inventory, stock and payment visibility, seamless communication, cost efficiency, credit notes for dealers, reduced credit cycles, and support for both traditional and online payment methods have all been integrated into a single B2B-B2C eCommerce site.
